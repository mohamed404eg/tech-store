              Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via
              the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of
              the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon
              the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which will
              prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the
              contrary on the Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary
              any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by

              Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary
              the order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both
              parties.
